# getopts_long

This is a pure BASH implementation of `getopts_long` function, which "upgrades" bash built-in `getopts` with support for GNU style long options, such as:

  - `--option`
  - `--option value`
  - `--option=value`

This function is 100% compatible with the built-in `getopts`. It is implemented with no external dependencies, and relies solely on BASH built-in tools to provide all of its functionality.

## Usage

The syntax for `getopts_long` is the same as the syntax for the built-in `getopts`:

``` bash
getopts_long OPTSPEC VARNAME [ARGS...]
```

where:

| name    | description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| OPTSPEC | A list of expected options and arguments. |
| VARNAME | A shell-variable to use for option reporting. |
| ARGS    | an optional list of arguments to parse. If omitted then `getopts_long` will parse arguments supplied to the script. |

### Extended OPTSPEC

An OPTSPEC string tells `getopts_long` which options to expect and which of them must have an argument. The syntax is very simple:

- single-character options are named first (identical to the built-in `getopts`);
- long options follow the single-character options, they are named as is and are separated from each other and the single-character options by a space.

Just like with the original `getopts`, when you want `getopts_long` to expect an argument for an option, just place a `:` (colon) after the option.

For example, given `'af: all file:'` as the OPTSPEC string, `getopts_long` will recognise the following options:

- `-a` - a single character (short) option with no argument;
- `-f ARG` - a single character (short) option with an argument;
- `--all` - a multi-character (long) option with no argument;
- `--file ARG` - a multi-character (long) option with an argument.

If the very first character of the optspec-string is a `:` (colon), which would normally be nonsense because there's no option letter preceding it, `getopts_long` switches to "silent error reporting mode" (See [Error Reporting](#error-reporting) for more info).

In production scripts, "silent mode" is usually what you want because it allows you to handle errors yourself without being distracted by default error messages. It's also easier to handle, since the failure cases are indicated by assigning distinct characters to `VARNAME`.

### Example script

A good example is worth a thousand words, so here is an example of how you could use the function within a script:

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source "${PATH_TO_REPO}/lib/getopts_long.bash"

while getopts_long ':af: all file:' 'OPTKEY'; do
    case ${OPTKEY} in
        'a'|'all')
            echo 'all triggered'
            ;;
        'f'|'file')
            echo "file supplied -- ${OPTARG}"
            ;;
        '?')
            echo "INVALID OPTION -- ${OPTARG}" >&2
            exit 1
            ;;
        ':')
            echo "MISSING ARGUMENT for option -- ${OPTARG}" >&2
            exit 1
            ;;
        *)
            echo "UNCAUGHT OPTION -- ${OPTKEY}" >&2
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
done

shift $(( OPTIND - 1 ))
[[ "${1}" == "--" ]] && shift

...
```

## How it works

In general the use of `getopts_long` is identical to that of BASH built-in `getopts`: you need to call `getopts_long` several times. Each time it will use the next positional parameter and a possible argument, if parsable, and provide it to you. The function will not change the set of positional parameters. If you want to shift them, it must be done manually:

``` bash
shift $(( OPTIND - 1 ))
# now do something with $@
```

Just like `getopts`, `getopts_long` sets an exit status to FALSE when there's nothing left to parse. Thus, it's easy to use in a while-loop:

``` bash
while getopts ...; do
  ...
done
```

Identical to `getopts`, `getopts_long` will parse options and their possible arguments. It will stop parsing on the first non-option argument (a string that doesn't begin with a hyphen (`-`) that isn't an argument for any option in front of it). It will also stop parsing when it sees the `--` (double-hyphen), which means end of options.

Like the original `getopts`, `getopts_long` sets the following variables:

| variable | description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| OPTIND   | Holds the index to the next argument to be processed. This is how the function "remembers" its own status between invocations. OPTIND is initially set to 1, and **needs to be re-set to 1 if you want to parse anything again with getopts**. |
| OPTARG   | This variable is set to any argument for an option found by `getopts_long`. It also contains the option flag of an unknown option. |
| OPTERR   | (Values 0 or 1) Indicates if Bash should display error messages generated by `getopts_long`. The value is initialised to 1 on every shell startup - so be sure to always set it to 0 if you don't want to see annoying messages! <br><br> OPTERR is not specified by POSIX for the getopts builtin utility â€” only for the C getopt() function in unistd.h (opterr). OPTERR is bash-specific and not supported by shells such as ksh93, mksh, zsh, or dash. |

## Error reporting

Regarding error-reporting, there are two modes `getopts_long` can run in:

  - verbose mode
  - silent mode

In production scripts I recommend using the silent mode, because it allows you to handle errors yourself without being distracted by default error messages. It's also easier to handle, since the failure cases are indicated by assigning distinct characters to `VARNAME`.

### Verbose mode

| Error type                  | What happens |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| invalid option              | `VARNAME` is set to `?` (question-mark) and `OPTARG` is unset. |
| required argument not found | `VARNAME` is set to `?` (question-mark), `OPTARG` is unset and an _error message is printed_. |

### Silent mode

| Error type                  | What happens |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| invalid option              | `VARNAME` is set to `?` (question-mark) and `OPTARG` is set to the (invalid) option character. |
| required argument not found | `VARNAME` is set to `:` (colon) and `OPTARG` contains the option in question. |

## Tests

In order to run the tests you need to have [Bash Automated Testing System (BATS)](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) installed. Please consult [their repository](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for the installation instructions.

Once `bats` is installed, `getopts_long` test suit can be run simply be executing the following command in the top directory of this repo:

```
bats test
```
